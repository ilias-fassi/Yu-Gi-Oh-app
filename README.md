# Yu-Gi-Oh-app
Web app to support your Yu-Gi-Oh dueling experience

This web app is a support for the YU-GI-OH! card game.
You can :
- manage and track life points by clicking on the buttons to increase, decrease, halve or reset players' life points.
- manage duel time by clicking start/pause/reset buttons.
- do a die roll to determine which player is going to be first to play.
- toss a coin if needed during the games.
- note a token stats to remind it.
- check life points logs to make sure you haven't done any mistake with life points management.
- calculate probability of drawing between "Min/hand" and "Max/hand" cards in a "Hand size" cards hand among a "Deck size" cards deck, while having "Quantity/deck" of successful draw.
For example, the probability to draw between one and three copies of a three-of card in a 5 cards hand among a 40 cards deck is equal to 33.76%
